He graduated with a BA in Communications from California State University, Fullerton. He is attending UCI's Full Stack Web Development where he is focusing on the MERN stack. His relationship with computers began at an early age. As the son of a physics and special education teacher, was lucky enough that his parents brought home a Macintosh Classic computer for the summer. Playing video games such as Odell Lake, The Oregon Trail, and Where in the World is Carmen San Diego developed a passion for learning and pixels.

                    Zac is passionate about education and volunteers working with young students and schools to foster an excitement towards technology and photography that was critical to him at a young age. Most recently, he volunteered for a fundraiser at St. Lucy's school taking pictures of Santa with the student body. In his free time, he is a giant sports fan of the Lakers and Dodgers and is sad that Game of Thrones is drawing to a close.
